Smart Community Banking System (SCBS)

Project Overview
This is a simple offline banking simulation system built using only C++.
It is designed to teach real-world programming logic with C++ including structs, enums, OOP, file handling, and basic data structures.
The project helps local Ethiopian communities by supporting easy community savings, offline account management, and goal tracking.
Problem It Solves

Many current banking systems in Ethiopia require internet access, are complex, or do not support educational and community-based features.
This system solves that by being offline-based, easy to understand, and beginner-friendly.
It also adds features that are not yet in real banking systems, like community fund savings, gamified financial tips, and personal goals.

Core Features

Create and manage user accounts.
Deposit and withdraw money safely.
Send money between users.
View balance and transaction history.
Set personal savings goals with progress tracking.
Get random financial tips to educate users.
Use a shared community fund for local needs.
Admin can view all user details and manage the system.
Tools and Concepts Used

C++ console application.
File handling to save and load account data.
Structs and enums for clean data organization.
OOP with classes for accounts and transactions.
Arrays and simple data sorting.
No external libraries or frameworks.

How to Run
Clone the project or download the files.
Use any C++ compiler like g++ or CodeBlocks.
Compile all `.cpp` files and run the final output.

Project Phases

1.Phase 1: Learn basics of C++ with simple file handling and structs.
2. Phase 2: Add classes for accounts and user login.
3.Phase 3: Implement money transactions and savings goals.
4.Phase 4: Add community fund gamification and admin panel.

Unique Features of the Project

 Offline system usable without internet.
 Supports community savings goals for events like school or health needs.
 Displays small educational tips about money in Amharic or English.
 Simple enough to be run from a basic computer.

Skills You Will Learn
